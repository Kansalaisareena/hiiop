** TODO Overview

** Dependencies
   - PostgreSQL
   - Redis
   - sassc
   - leiningen

** Setup
   To get an interactive development environment run:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   lein run
   lein figwheel
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   and open your browser at [[http://localhost:3000/][localhost:3000]].
   This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
   need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
   get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   (js/alert "Am I connected?")
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   and you should see an alert in the browser window.

   To clean all compiled files:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   lein clean
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   To create a production build run:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   lein do clean
   cljsbuild once min
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
   get live reloading, nor a REPL.
